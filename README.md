# Forest

Forest is an generative exploration game: as you wander in new directions, the
world is created based on what you showed preference for before.

Forest is a port of a hackathon project I did on the Oculus
(https://github.com/BrownRiceRice/oculus-hackrice16).

## TODOs:

* Finish README and start issues to track rest of the things on github
* Enhance
  * [ ] Include Rocks in the randomly generated things.
  * [ ] Start the models off very small and make them bigger.
  * [ ] [Add shading](http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/beginners-tutorials/tutorial-8-basic-shading/)
    * [ ] Add normal information per vertex
  * [ ] Add a title screen, and fade to the initial scene.
  * [ ] [Add shadows](http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/intermediate-tutorials/tutorial-16-shadow-mapping/)
     but see if it works with the aesthetic.
* Optimize
  * [ ] Switch to [VBO Indexing](http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/intermediate-tutorials/tutorial-9-vbo-indexing/)
  * [ ] Add toggled [FPS counter](http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/miscellaneous/an-fps-counter/)
  * [ ] Use key callbacks instead of checking each loop.
